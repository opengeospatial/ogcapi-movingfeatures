|*Abstract Test {counter:conf-id}* |*/conf/movingfeatures/features-get*
|Requirement    |
<<req_mf-features-op-get, /req/movingfeatures/features-get>> +
<<req_mf-features-response-get, /ref/movingfeatures/features-get-success>>
|Test purpose   | Validate that MovingFeatures can be identified and extracted from a MovingFeature Collection using query parameters.
|Test method    |
For every MovingFeature Collection identified in MovingFeature Collections, issue an HTTP GET request to the URL `{root}/collections/{collectionId}/items` where `{collectionId}` is the id property for a MovingFeature Collection described in the MovingFeature Collections content

1. Validate that a document was returned with a status code `200` +
2. Validate the contents of the returned document using test <<conf_mf_features_get_success, `/conf/movingfeatures/features-get-success`>>

Repeat these tests using the following parameter tests that defined in the OGC API-Common: +
- Bounding Box: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_bounding_box_tests[Bounding Box Tests] +
- Limit: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_limit_tests[Limit Tests] +
- Date-Time: link:http://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/20-024.html#_date_time_tests[Date-Time Tests]

Execute requests with combinations of the `"bbox"` and `"datetime"` query parameters and verify that only features are returned that match both selection criteria.
