== Scope
The scope of the OGC API — Moving Features — Part 1:Core is to provide a uniform way to access, communicate, and manage data about moving features across different applications, data providers, and data consumers.
The OGC API — MF defines a set of API building blocks that enable clients to discover, retrieve, and update information about moving features, as well as a data model for describing moving features and their trajectories.

The OGC API — Moving Features — Part 1:Core Draft Standard defines an API with two goals.
First, to provide access to representations of Moving Features that conform to the <<OGC-MF-JSON, OGC Moving Features JSON Encoding Standard>>.
Second, to provide functionality comparable to that of the <<OGC-MF-Access, OGC Moving Features Access Standard>>.
The OGC API — Moving Features Draft Standard is an extension of the <<OGC-API-Common, OGC API — Common>> and the <<OGC-API-Features, OGC API — Features Standards>>.
