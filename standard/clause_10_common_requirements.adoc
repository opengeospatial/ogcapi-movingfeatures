[[http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP Status Codes

<<status-codes>> lists the main HTTP status codes that clients should be prepared to receive.
This includes support for specific security schemes or URI redirection.
In addition, other error situations may occur in the transport layer outside of the server.

|Status code |Description
|`200` |A successful request.
|`201` |The server has been fulfilled the operation and a new resource has been created.
|`202` |A successful request, but the response is still being generated. The response will include a  `Retry-After` header field giving a recommendation in seconds for the client to retry.
|`204` |A successful request, but the resource has no data resulting from the request.  No additional content or message body is provided.
|`304` |An entity tag was provided in the request and the resource has not been changed since the previous request.
|`308` |The server cannot process the data through a synchronous request.  The response includes a `Location` header field which contains the URI of the location the result will be available at once the query is complete Asynchronous queries.
|`400` |The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error. For example, a query parameter had an incorrect value.
|`401` |The request requires user authentication. The response includes a `WWW-Authenticate` header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource.
|`403` |The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. While status code `401` indicates missing or bad authentication, status code `403` indicates that authentication is not the issue, but the client is not authorized to perform the requested operation on the resource.
|`404` |The requested resource does not exist on the server. For example, a path parameter had an incorrect value.
|`405` |The request method is not supported. For example, a POST request was submitted, but the resource only supports GET requests.
|`406` |Content negotiation failed. For example, the `Accept` header submitted in the request did not support any of the media types supported by the server for the requested resource.
|`413` |Request entity too large. For example the query would involve returning more data than the server is capable of processing, the implementation should return a message explaining the query limits imposed by the server implementation.
|`500` |An internal error occurred in the server.
