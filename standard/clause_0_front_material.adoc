//== Introduction
[big]*i.     Abstract*

Moving feature data can represent various phenomena, including vehicles, people, animals, weather patterns, etc.
The OGC API — Moving Features (OGC API — MF) is a Draft Standard defines a standard interface for querying and accessing geospatial data that changes over time, such as the location and attributes of moving objects like vehicles, vessels, or pedestrians.
The OGC API — MF provides a standard way to manage these data, which can be helpful for applications such as transportation management, disaster response, and environmental monitoring.
OGC API — MF also includes operations for filtering, sorting, and aggregating moving feature data based on location, time, and other properties.

The OGC API — Moving Features — Part 1: Core specifies a set of RESTful web service interfaces and data formats for querying and updating moving feature data over the web.
<<OGC-API,OGC API Standards>> define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way.
<<OPENAPI,OpenAPI>> is used to define the reusable API building blocks with responses in JSON and HTML.

The OGC API family of standards is organized by resource type.

*OGC Declaration*

Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights.
The Open Geospatial Consortium shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.

Recipients of this document are requested to submit, with their comments, notification of any relevant patent claims

[big]*iv.   Security Considerations*

The OGC API — Moving Features — Part 1: Core Draft Standard does not mandate any specific security controls.
However, it was constructed to add security controls without impacting conformance, the same as the link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html#_91afaabd-dc29-41eb-805d-15e1afd18825[OGC API — Common — Part 1: Core].

This document applied the Requirement link:https://docs.ogc.org/is/19-072/19-072.html#rc_oas30-security[/req/oas30/security] for OpenAPI 3.0 Security support.
